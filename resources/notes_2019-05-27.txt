I donâ€™t know how aggregate demand for each private good was generated 
(called for). In that case the code must have called for summing all 
the CC demands for each of the two private final goods. For the public 
good you need to change that command, and direct the program to calculate 
the AVERAGE of all the CC demands for the public good. That average IS the 
aggregate demand for the public good.

I want to focus on this definition for a moment:

"Aggregate Demand: This is where things are different for the public good. 
Instead of summing the individual demands, calculate the AVERAGE of all 
demands for the public good coming from all of the consumer councils, CCs."

Question: I currently don't have a public-good demand noted in the consumer 
council data structure.  I think I need to add one.  If so, what should my 
starting value be for public-good-demands?  For reference, here's an example 
of a CC as currently noted:

{:id 0, :cy 12.950838032319478, :effort 1, :final-demands [0 0 0 0 0], 
:income 5000, :num-workers 10, :utility-exponents [0.1405350051197347 
0.24012723273335457 0.13060457354838528 0.15357560280503046], 
:public-good-exponents [0.023363354664267068]}

Seems that maybe you've already moved past this, but just in case it helps:

The demand for public goods of each consumer council can be initialized at 0, just 
like the demand for private goods is currently. The actual demand is calculated 
piece-wise, as each consumer council performs its optimization based on the current 
price schedule and reports its proposed consumption for the planning period. Then 
all of the individual demands for each good are summed, or in the case of public 
goods averaged (as we've discussed at length) to come up with the aggregate demand 
for each good. These variables are currently not stored globally, but are computed 
as needed from the current consumption proposals, in the local scope of the 
planning-bureau procedure--one local variable called 'demand' represents the 
aggregate demand for each good within the loop that computes the price adjustment 
for the final goods. A parallel loop structure should be created for public goods, 
to make the necessary price adjustment for each public good in the model (currently 
only one type, but potentially more than one in future).
