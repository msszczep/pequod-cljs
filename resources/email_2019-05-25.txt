Hi, folks.

I need some help on a problem.

You'll recall that two phone-calls ago, I wasn't sure how to add public-goods to the 
get-supply-list and get-demand-list functions in pequod-cljs (the Netlogo equivalents
of the reporters supply-list and demand-list in pequod2.nlogo).  At the time, we said
that both reporters were simply reporter functions and had nothing to do with the 
innards of the procedure and could be safely ignored.  

It turns out, upon further investigation, that this is not the case.  The reporters 
_are_ being used -- in the price-change and other-price-change functions which 
adjust the price-deltas and pdlist variables.  We missed it because that functionality
appears in a different file in Netlog -- in price-adjustment.nls, rather than the main
pequod2.nlogo.

I suspect that this is related to the cascade of errors I'm currently seeing, so we
need to return to updating get-demand-list.  get-supply-list has been updated
to include in public goods: we simply get all the worker councils with industry = 2,
get their outputs, add them all up, put the sum in a vector, and put that vector as 
part of the supply-list output.  However, I need some guidance on how to update
get-demand-list; how do I code for the aggregate demand for the public goods, or
how should I?   

We discuss via email, or we can wait until Monday or later in the week if it works
for folks.

Thanks.
