; See the Info tab for the model in NetLogo for model purpose,
; etc. The agents, variables, procedures, and reporters of the model
; are documented directly below, with some minor information
; documented within the code.
;
; Documentation is in-progress. The text "@..." occurs where more
; information will be added.

;
; @AGENTS
;
; The primary agents of the model are councils whose collective
; behavior affects prices and quantities for supply and demand.
;
; cc - consumer council
; wc - worker council
